# AMICO
# Macros for Image Cytometry Analysis by Fluorescence Microscopy in ImageJ. 
The site is under construction. For more information take a look at the references below or write to mario.faretta@ieo.it
The macros were tested on ImageJ 1.53n, JAVA 1.8.0_172 (64-bit) on Windows 8.1.

# AMICO_Union.txt
Macro to Browse through Acquired Images, Set for Segmentation and Analysis of Particles, Set of intracellular subcompartment (e.g. foci) recognition. Results are stored in a tab-txt file.
# AMICO_Plotting.txt
Macro to analyze the results of AMICO_Union Image Analysis producing Dot Plots and Histograms. It is possible to define Regions of Interest and combine them into logical gates as normally done in flow-cytometry.
